Project Title
Briefly describe what your project does and its primary purpose.

Installation
Outline the steps someone needs to follow to get your project up and running on their machine. For instance:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up any configuration files (if needed).
Usage
Explain how someone can use your code. Provide examples or code snippets if applicable. For instance:

To run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python your_app_name.py
Configuration
If your code requires any configuration or API keys, instruct users on how to set those up. You might want to mention the need to create a secret.py file with the required API keys and variables.

Additional Notes
If there's anything else users need to know, such as limitations, special instructions, or potential updates, mention that here.

Contributions
If you're open to contributions or collaboration, mention how others can contribute to your project or report issues.

Feel free to expand each section as needed and customize it to fit your project. Also, consider adding badges (like build status, version, etc.) or a table of contents to make it more user-friendly.
